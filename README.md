# Huffman Coding Implementation

This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm, in Python. It reads text from a file, calculates character frequencies, constructs a Huffman tree, generates prefix-free codes, and encodes/decodes the text. The implementation is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of Huffman coding for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Frequency Calculation**: Computes the frequency of each character in the input text.
- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Builds a Huffman tree using a priority queue.
- **Code Generation**: Generates variable-length prefix-free codes for each character.
- **Encoding/Decoding**: Encodes text into a compressed binary string and decodes it back to the original text.
- **File Input**: Reads input text from a file (`huffman.txt`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- A text file named `huffman.txt` in the specified directory containing the text to compress.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/Kanishkjain0510/Huffman-Encoding.git'
